Ils se d\\u00e9rouleront du haut vers le bas et les \\u00e9chafaudages seront d\\u00e9mont\\u00e9s d\\u00e8s qu&rsquo;une partie sera termin\\u00e9e.

Junge und Alte, Besucher und Einwohner kommen in den zahlreichen Stra\\u00dfencaf\\u00e9s und am Ufer zusammen. Dies ist das pulsierende Herz der Genter Innenstadt.\\r\\nDas Getreidemesserhaus, das Gildehaus der Freien Schiffer, das Stapelhaus ''Spijker'' ... jedes Haus an der Graslei verf\\u00fcgt \\u00fcber seine eigene Geschichte. Zusammen erz\\u00e4hlen sie die Geschichte der beachtlichen wirtschaftlichen Bl\\u00fcte Gents im Mittelalter. An der anderen Seite des Wassers liegt der Korenlei. Von einigen historischen Geb\\u00e4uden ist nur noch die Fassade im urspr\\u00fcnglichen Zustand erhalten.
